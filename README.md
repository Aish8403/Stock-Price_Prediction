# üìà Stock Price Prediction with FastAPI & React

## üìå Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-based Stock Price Prediction** system that allows users to input stock-related features, select an ML model, and receive a prediction probability. The backend is built with **FastAPI**, while the frontend uses **React.js** to provide an interactive user experience. The trained ML models are used to make stock price predictions based on historical data.

## üß† Machine Learning Models Used

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression**
A fundamental linear classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a given class. It is efficient for binary classification problems and provides interpretable results. Logistic Regression uses the sigmoid function to model the probability of a stock price movement.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Support Vector Classifier (SVM)**
A supervised learning model that finds the optimal hyperplane for classification tasks. The polynomial kernel is used to handle non-linear decision boundaries. SVM with probability=True allows the model to output probability estimates, which are useful for predicting stock price trends.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost Classifier**
An advanced gradient boosting algorithm that is widely used for structured data classification. XGBoost improves performance by reducing overfitting through regularization techniques and boosting weak learners iteratively. This model is known for its high accuracy and efficiency in stock price prediction tasks.
